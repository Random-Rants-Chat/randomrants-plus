## What is Random Rants +?

Random Rants + is the next generation of Random Rants,
aimed towards having new functions and is more like an actual social media site.
Random Rants + also aims for the fun of the original Random Rants, so you don't get
as bored easily.

## Installation and building

*Make sure you set the fbBucket enviroment variable to your google firebase's storage bucket, making sure the permissions on it are set to public.*

*If you don't want to run the server from your personal device, you can remix the site on glitch.com [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/randomrants-plus)*

I recommend using Node.JS 16.x, then either `git clone https://github.com/Random-Rants-Chat/randomrants-plus.git` onto your computer or download by zip.

In the directory of package.json, run `npm install`. After that, use `npm run build` to build the website, and use `npm run start` to start up the server.

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the functional Random Rants + site in action.
