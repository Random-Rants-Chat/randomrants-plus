How much chaos would this make?
I get grounded commonly, how could I possibly ever know why?
OH MY GOD, WOW!
I usually don't spend money to make my websites.
Who needs discord, when you got this?
Random Rants is not actually the first chatting program I made.
Powered by glitch.com!
Time for some super sonic speed!

Teachers hate this one simple website.
Probably not safe for class.
Just one more message, I swear!

The soundboard has entered the chat.
Revolutionizing distractions since launch day.
Who needs therapy when you have this?
This was a good idea. Probably.
Orange Fanta: the official dev fuel.

Now you see why I don't have a PC in my hands at home?
Fueled by pure Fanta and poor decisions
Not responsible for any detentions caused.

I turned my homework in... to this website.

Technically not illegal... yet.
Nobody: Me: Sends 100 memes at once.
Press F to respect your free time
As seen in your browser history.
If this is open, you’re probably procrastinating.
This is why I don’t get sleep.
Making memories, breaking rules.
Still better than Zoom.
Sometimes it works. Sometimes it really works.
Certified Fanta-fueled experience
If the principal asks, this is educational.
Built different. Like, really different.
Random Rants +: Home of the chronically online.
Soundboard: Because silence is boring
"Why are you like this?" – probably your teacher

Every click makes the dev smile and the admin cry
I joined once and now I live here
Built on Fanta, memes, and HTML
You didn’t find this site. It found you.
More unstable than my sleep schedule
Made during class. Maintained during detention.
Someone said "quiet time" and we heard "soundboard."
Banned in three schools and counting
Is this really funnier than discord? I think so.
You gota try it first.
Broadcasting live from quarantine
Sniffling, coughing, and still Random Ranting
Absent but very present
This is my sick day social life
I’m out sick... but the memes must go on
Day 3: The tissues are gone, but the chat is alive
Too sick for school, not too sick for Random Rants +
Why rest when you can spam the soundboard remotely?
Coughing? Yes. Chatting? Always.
Home alone and haunting the group chat
Digital presence > physical attendance
This message was typed between sneezes
Feeling gross but still funny
School misses me. Probably.
Spreading chaos, not germs
Down but not offline
Sick in body, strong in chat
When your voice is gone but your memes still speak
Orange Fanta: Official recovery drink
Silently judging your spelling mistakes
I’ve been here the whole time... just lurking
I don’t talk much... until the soundboard drops
The quiet kid just posted a banger
You didn’t notice me, but I saw everything
Silent in class, loud in chat
Probably listening. Probably scheming.
I only speak when it’s absolutely unhinged
Mic off. Chaos on.
The one in the back just pinged the whole chat
I don't say much, but when I do, it's cursed
This message came from the shadows
Still hasn't spoken. Still funnier than you.
Stealth mode activated
Cam off, soundboard loud
You didn’t even know I was here, huh?

Their stylus is a Q-tip on a fork

Bought a Bluetooth speaker that also fries eggs
Money can’t buy taste, apparently

Wait, is this even legal?
Welcome to Random Rants +. Prepare for utter nonsense.
Don’t blame me if this site leads to questionable life choices.
When someone presses play, everyone hears the chaos.
One soundboard to rule them all... and ruin everyone's focus.
When someone presses play, everyone hears the chaos.
This soundboard is not solo... it’s a team weapon.
Shared soundboard: Because everyone deserves to hear the airhorn.
Chat, memes, and a soundboard louder than your motivation.
WARNING: One click = total room-wide chaos.
Teachers hate this one simple trick: letting everyone blast memes at once.
Random Rants +: The site that made 3 teachers give up mid-class.
Too loud to be educational. Too fun to stop.
Random Rants +: Because Google Classroom didn’t have enough bass boost.
Talk quietly? No. Chat loudly with memes.
Made for students in different classes. Perfect for spreading nonsense.
The secret chat system they never saw coming.
This isn’t learning—it’s loud, shared rebellion.
When passing notes wasn’t an option, this was.
Random Rants +: For when you’re not allowed to talk, but still do.
Not allowed to speak? Just blast a vine boom instead.
Sneaky, chaotic, Chromebook-certified.
Helping students communicate... whether teachers want it or not.
Designed for silence. Perfected for maximum noise.
Chat between classes, break the system just a bit.
Quiet class? Not anymore.
Shhh... they’re watching. But we’re still chatting.
Chromebook mode: stealthy messages and surprise airhorns.
This isn’t Google Docs chat... it’s better.
What started as a simple chat turned into a digital riot.
We wanted connection. We got chaos.
Quick! Switch tabs!
This tab? Oh, just doing research...
Random Rants +: The fastest tab you'll ever close.
Homework tab in the front. Chaos in the back.
Alt + Tab is a survival skill.
“I was just checking my grades!”
This site runs faster when your teacher isn’t looking.
Got caught? Just say it’s a collaborative project.
One tab for Google Docs. One tab for pure chaos.
Random Rants +: Best used with quick reflexes.
Click off! Click off! Click off!
When in doubt, open Google Classroom in the next tab.
If found: pretend it’s coding practice.
The tab teachers hope you don’t find.
Sounds like fun? That's just your other tab.
Close this tab = instant disappointment.
Random Rants +: The reason you need split-screen skills.
“Why do you have 12 tabs open?” …No reason. 🙂
Definitely not playing memes in class.
This looks like work if you squint.
“No, I’m not on that soundboard site again...”
Google Docs in the front. Chaos in the back.
Chromebook multitasking: meme now, assignment later.
This site runs better when you're pretending to be productive.
Trust me, it’s for a project.
I swear I was just adjusting the volume!
Caught in 4K. Still worth it.
“I thought this was part of the curriculum.”
Alt + Tab is my favorite subject.
Fun fact: This tab is invisible if you believe hard enough.
Random Rants +: Use at your own risk (of fun).
“It’s educational… sort of.”
The teacher’s walking over... close it NOW!
Chromebook battery: 12%. Chaos: 100%.
Looks like a spreadsheet. Sounds like a meme war.
Just me, doing my digital citizenship assignment...
This is a group project. The group is chaos.
Why yes, I do know how to look productive.
Alt + Tab: The true final boss.
“This is part of computer science, I swear!”
Shared your game? Now the whole class is “testing” it.
“You can share anything?” Yes. And that’s the problem.
Shared Minecraft, broke five Chromebooks.
Who needs Google Drive when you’ve got Random Rants +?
This is not an educational tool. It’s a chaos engine.
One click and suddenly you’re in a Kahoot full of memes.
Random Rants +: If it runs in a browser, it’s getting shared.
From memes to multiplayer, all tabs welcome.
Games, videos, cursed slideshows—send it all.
“Wait… you’re seeing my screen too?!”
From silent study session to multiplayer mayhem in 3… 2…
100% collaborative. 0% productive.
This site does not have a filter. You are the filter.
Random Rants +: Where every tab is a shared experience... whether you want it or not.
Stream your browser, share your downfall.
Group chats? Cool. Group chaos? Better.
Shared media, shared volume, shared regret.
“What even is this site?” — Everyone, eventually.
Welcome to the only site where schoolwork and Smash Bros coexist.
“Is this... Discord in disguise?” — every teacher ever
Admin tried to block it. Failed.
“Why is the entire class in one chatroom?!”
Banned on 3 school networks. Still running.
“We do not support this website.” — Principal
Random Rants +: Causing IT headaches since launch.
“Stop playing that sound!” “I didn’t!”
This site is NOT part of the lesson plan.
Chromebook volume mysteriously maxed out? Yeah. That was us.
“We heard... noises coming from the lab.”
Teachers fear it. Students love it.
“Another anonymous tab... what even is this?!”
Blocked during class. Unblocked by lunch.
“It’s not educational” — yet here you are reading this.
Confiscated laptops can’t stop the soundboard.
The reason tech support keeps getting emails.
“Whose idea was this site?” — A question with no safe answer.
